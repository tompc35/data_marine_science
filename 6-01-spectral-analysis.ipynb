    "# Spectral Analysis \n",
    " \n",
    "Spectral analysis is a common form of time series analysis. It involves analyzing the variance in a time series, and the contribution of different frequencies. One common example in the ocean is the spectrum of wave energy observed by a buoy. The example below is from a [buoy offshore of Monterey Bay](https://www.ndbc.noaa.gov/station_page.php?station=46042).\n",

    "\n",
    "Frequency is expressed in units of [Hz], or [cycles/s] on the lower horizontal axis. These frequencies $f$ are the reciprocal of the wave period $T$, or $f = 1/T$. The corresponding periods are shown on the upper horizontal axis. The prominent peak in the plot is showing that the largest waves have a period just over 10 s, or a frequency just below 0.1 Hz. This is sometimes refered to as the *dominant period*, the period that dominates the wave energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The units on the vertical axis are representing variance per unit frequency. If the height of the sea surface is measured in units of [m], then the variance of the surface elevation has units [m$^2$]. When we split the variance into the contributions of different frequencies, then we get units of [m$^2$]/Hz].\n",

We can also think about complex numbers as vectors with a magnitude($r$) and angle/phase ($\\phi$). Trigonometry can be used to describe the relationship between these two types of vector representation.\n",

    "Although we often think of exponential functions as growth or decay, an exponential with an imaginary exponent describes oscillations (i.e. sines and consines). The literature on spectral analysis often uses this type of equation."

When analyzing time series with real values (no imaginary components), the information corresponding to the positive and negative frequencies is redundant.
