# Setup and software installation

## Storage requirements

You will need at least 2 GB free on your computer's hard drive.

## Sign up for a GitHub account

[Github](https://github.com) is a popular remote repository hosting service. This is a way to store and share version controlled software off of your computer. You can think of this sort of like Dropbox for code. Sign up for an account, if you do not already have one.

## Install Visual Studio Code

VS Code is a text editor designed for programming. VS Code is available on all operating systems and has some cool custom plugins.
Â 
Download an installer from the [Visual Studio Code website](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and run it.

## Install Miniconda

### What is Miniconda?

Anaconda is a popular distribution of Python and a set of programs built specifically for data science. Miniconda is stripped-down version of Anaconda. We will use Miniconda, and add additional programs manually, so that it does not take up as much space on your computer. Miniconda includes:
* *Python*: Programming language (we'll be using version 3.10)
* *Conda*: Package manager

*Conda* is a package manager. It maintains the directories (folder pathways) and versions of external (non-default) python packages. A package is a set of Python tools designed for a specific purpose. Some of these are included with Python, but others have to be downloaded from an external source.

### If you have Anaconda or Miniconda already installed

If you have Anaconda or Miniconda already installed on your computer, follow the steps below. If not, move on to [Miniconda installation](#miniconda-installation).

First run Python and check which version you have. The version number is displayed when Python starts up.

To maintain consistency, we will be using Python version 3.10 in this class. Previous versions of Python 3.x will work most of the time in classroom demonstrations and other course materials, but you may run into a few cases where certain commands are invalid or not available. Python 2.x is completely incompatible with the course material. If your version is already 3.10, proceed to [installing additional tools](#installing-additional-tools).

If you have a different version of Python, you have two options:

1. Uninstall the previous installation. Note that option 2 below may be better if you already have Python code that you want to keep running on the same version of Python. If you choose option 1, find the uninstall instructions for your operating system at https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html#regular-installation. For Mac and Windows installations, be sure to remove the Miniconda or Anaconda directory from your home folder. Restart your terminal and proceed with the [Miniconda installation](#miniconda-installation) steps below.

2. *Advanced:* Create a new *environment* for this class.

Option 2 will allow you to use the same Python version and packages as the rest of the class, without altering your existing setup. For more information on environments, see https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html

Open a terminal (Mac) or Anaconda prompt (Windows) and type:

```
conda create --name ms263-23 python=3.10
```

You can replace `ms263-23` with any name you like for your environment. To enter the new environment, type:

```
conda activate ms263-23
```

You will have to repeat this command whenever you start a new terminal or Anaconda prompt.

Keep this window open and proceed to [Installing additional tools](#installing-additional-tools)

### Miniconda installation

1) Go to: https://conda.io/miniconda.html

2. Select *Python 3.10* version. Download the appropriate installer for your operating system and run. The default options will be fine.

  * <b>Windows</b>: Select 32-bit or 64-bit. Chances are, with a newer computer, your operating system is 64-bit. If you do not know, try 64-bit and the installer will tell you if you made the wrong choice. Click on the installer file to download it.

  * <b>Mac</b>: There are two different options for installers. Download the .pkg installer and click on it.

### Open a terminal or command prompt

* [Windows instructions](#windows-instructions)

* [Mac instructions](#mac-instructions)

#### Windows instructions
After installing Anaconda, open the program <b>"Anaconda Prompt"</b>
You might have to search for this in the start menu.<br>

```{image} images/comd_prompt_windows.png
:alt: Windows command prompt
:width: 300px
:align: left
```

Clicking *Anaconda Prompt* will bring up a screen where you can type commands. Keep this window open and follow the steps under [Installing additional tools](#installing-additional-tools)

#### Mac instructions

After installing Anaconda, open the program <b>"Terminal"</b>

This is located in Applications -> Utilities

Or you can search for "Terminal" in the spotlight (use press cmd-space).

```{image} images/comd_prompt_osx.png
:alt: OSX command prompt
:width: 450px
:align: left
```

This will bring up a screen where you can type commands. Continue to the next section on [Installing additional tools using conda](#installing-additional-tools-using-conda)

## Installing additional tools

Now that you have a command line open, type these commands to install additional programs and Python packages that we will use throughout the semester.

First, add the [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/) channel as a source for obtaining packages. This is a  community-driven project that makes sure that none of the packages you download conflict with each other. Type (or copy and paste) the following on the command line and press Enter:

```
conda config --add channels conda-forge
```

Now, install the additional programs and Python packages. This will take a while. Copy and paste the following onto the command line and press Enter (**note:** this command is very long and probably extends beyond the width of your browser; the easiest way to copy it is to click the "copy" button that appears when you hover the cursor over the right side of the text box):

```
conda install jupyter jupyterlab matplotlib pandas xarray netCDF4 cartopy cmocean gsw scikit-image scikit-learn statsmodels uncertainties pingouin nb_conda_kernels
```

Here, `conda` is the name of the package management program and `install` is a command given to this program, followed by the names of programs to install. A description of the packages that you have just installed can be found [here](package-list.md).

## Update pingouin

Make sure you have the latest version of the pingouin statistical package. Enter this command to update:

```
conda update pingouin
```

## Install ipyml

This optional tool enhances plots by making them interactive. Enter these commands to install:

```
conda update jupyterlab
conda install ipympl
```

## Install PyCO2SYS

When those package installations have finished, there is one more tool that has be installed with a different package manager called `pip`. Enter this command:

```
pip install PyCO2SYS
```

## Install Git

Git is version control system that is commonly used in developing software projects. Enter this command:

```
conda install git
```

Choose the default options if prompted to make selections. If for some reason that method of installing Git does not work, you can download and install Git for your operating system by following the instructions at https://git-scm.com

### Windows only: open the Git Bash command line

If you have windows, check to make sure that you can open the Git Bash command prompt. You should be able to find Git Bash in the list of programs when you open the Windows Start menu.

Git Bash provides another interface for entering text commands. Using Git Bash will allow you to enter the same commands as a Mac or any other Unix-based system (like Linux). This will allow for consistency across the entire class and expose you to the commands commonly used on Unix-based servers.

## Open a text editor from the command line

Make sure that you can open a text editor from the command line.

### VS Code

First, try the VS Code text editor. On the command line, enter:

```
code
```

This should open a window in the VS Code text editor. If that worked, then you are all set.

### Nano

If for some reason you cannot open Atom from the command line, try the Nano text editor:

```
nano
```

This brings up a text editor in the terminal window. Enter Control-X to exit Nano.

### System default text editor

You can also try the default text editor for your operating system. These do not have as many features as Atom but will get the job done.

#### TextEdit (Mac)

```
open -e
```

#### Notepad (Windows)

```
notepad
```

If you are using Windows, it is highly recommended that you install the free [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) editor instead of using the default Notepad.

## Setup for Unix shell tutorial

On the first day of our data analysis course, we go through parts of the Software Carpentry <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/">Unix shell tutorial</a>. Software Carpentry is an organization that develops lessons and workshops to teach skills in research computing.

You need to download some files to follow this lesson. To prepare for this lesson, follow the steps listed at the beginning of the <a href="http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice/setup.html"> setup instructions </a> under "download files" and "open a new shell" (you have already installed all of the necessary software).
