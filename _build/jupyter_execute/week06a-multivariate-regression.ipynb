    "This three dimensional visualization shows how linear model based on two predictor variables, $x_1$ and $x_2$ can be used to model a response variable $y$. A constant and two slopes to define a 2D plane in 3D space. The sum of squared vertical distances between the plane (model) and observations of $y$ are minimized. Like fitting a line in 2D space, this procedure assumes the validity of a linear model.\n",

    "## Example: Model for aragonite saturation state based on three other oceanographic variables\n",
    "\n",
    "As a motivation for multiple linear regression, we consider a model for aragonite saturation state, $\\Omega_A$. The study by Juranek et al. (2009), discussed on greater detail below, uses multiple linear regression to model $\\Omega_A$ for surveys where it is not measured, using more commonly measured parameters. We know that $\\Omega_A$ depends on both physical and biological processes, so one candidate for a model might be:\n",

    "$N$ = 1011 samples\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we have three predictor variables, it is hard to visualize in four-dimensional space. However, the same principles are involved as fitting a 1D line in 2D space, or a 2D plane in 3D space.\n",

    "\n",
    "A linear model can be represented as a system of $N$ equations.\n",

    "where $\\hat{y}_i$ is a modeled value and $\\epsilon_i$ is the difference between the modeled value, $\\hat{y}_i$ and an observation $y_i$. The least squares regression minimizes the sum of $\\epsilon_i^2$, the overall deviation between the linear model and data.\n",
