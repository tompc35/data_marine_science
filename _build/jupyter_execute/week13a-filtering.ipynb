    "\n",
    "One of the common applications of convolution is *smoothing* data. Smoothing is used in time series analysis and image analysis to suppress noise or high-frequency variability. Another term for smoothing is *low-pass filter* becuase it suppresses high-frequency variability and allows low-frequency variability to pass through.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most common and intuitive smoothing operations is the __running Average__ (or *Box Car filter*). This involves taking the average over a certain block (30 hrs, 5 days ... etc), then moving forward in time and repeating the same process for the next segment of data."

    "\n",
    "For a running average, the weights in $g$ are all identical and sum to one. If you plot the weights, the look like a rectangle, or \"box car\" shape.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common filtering method is the __Hanning filter__, which is a raised cosine function. All the values are positive (and sum to 1). This weights nearby points more than those that are farther away. Choosing the best filter for a certain situation is a major topic in digital signal processing."
