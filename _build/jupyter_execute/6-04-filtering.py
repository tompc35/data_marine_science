# ## Filtering and Convolution
# 
# __Convolution__ is a process of blending two functions together to create a third. The convolution of two functions $f$ and $g$ is symbolized mathematically as $(f * g)$.
# 
# ### Convolution steps
# 
# For each point in $f$:
# 1. Flip $g$ around
# 2. Take product of $f$ and $g$ at all overlapping location times
# 3. Add the resulting values together
# 4. Move on to next point in $f$, repeat for different lag between $f$ and $g$
# 
# This process is very similar to the procedures for cross-covariance of two functions $f$ and $g$, and auto-covariance of a single function $g$ with itself.

# Expressing this procedure mathematically for two time series $f(t)$ and $g(t)$:
# 
# - $f$ has M samples, $f_k$ where k = 1,2,3...M
# - $g$ has N samples, $g_i$ where i = 1,2,3...N
#     
# $ (f * g)_j = \sum_{k=1}^M g_{j-k} f_k $
#     
# The resulting function has N+M-1 points.

# ### Filtering
# 
# One of the common applications of convolution is *smoothing* data. Smoothing is used in time series analysis and image analysis to suppress noise or high-frequency variability. Another term for smoothing is *low-pass filter* becuase it suppresses high-frequency variability and allows low-frequency variability to pass through.
# 
# One of the most common and intuitive smoothing operations is the __running Average__ (or *Box Car filter*). This involves taking the average over a certain block (30 hrs, 5 days ... etc), then moving forward in time and repeating the same process for the next segment of data.

# Filtering is a type of convolution where
# - $f$ is a time series (observations)<br>
# - $g$ is a set of weights (filter)
# 
# For a running average, the weights in $g$ are all identical and sum to one. If you plot the weights, the look like a rectangle, or "box car" shape.
# 
# Another common filtering method is the __Hanning filter__, which is a raised cosine function. All the values are positive (and sum to 1). This weights nearby points more than those that are farther away. Choosing the best filter for a certain situation is a major topic in digital signal processing.

# ### What makes an ideal low pass filter?

# *Note:* Images in this section come from the excellent source at http://www.labbookpages.co.uk/audio/firWindowing.html
# 
# For white noise (equal energy at all frequencies)
# * all energy in low frequencies (__pass band__) retrained
# * all energy in high frequencies (__stop band__) removed

# 
# __Ideal filter__ <br>
# Assuming an infinite time series, the filter would look like a sinc function:<br>
# - sinc function is the FFT of a step function 
# - convolving the sinc function with an infinitely long time series of white noise would give the step function in frequency content shown above
# - A sinc function would require an infinite number of weights (__this is NOT practical__)

# __ Spectral characteristics of filters __ <br>
# Spectrum of white nose using this approach with two window types (box car and Hamming): <br>
# - Ripples in frequency response of rectangular box car window (spectral leakage)<br>
# - Hamming window has less ripples but a broader transition range (trade-off)<br>

# __dB - decibels __: logogrithmic unit used to describe attenuation (reduction of energy)
# 
# $$ dB = 10 \log_{10}\left(\frac{A^2}{A_0^2}\right) $$ Where $ A_0 $ is a reference amplitude

# ## Common oceanographic filters
# 
# ### Cosine-Lanczos Filter
# - "Lancz7" filter: designed to filter out energy at diurnal and tidal fequencies
# - Half amplitude period = 34.29 hours
# - Half amplitude frequency = 0.7 cpd

# 
# ### Take Home Points: filtering <br>
# 
# - Boxcar filters (running averages) are simple but not very effective
# 
# - A normalized Hanning window improves on the boxcar by soothing out the abrupt edges
# 
# - More sophisticated filters (e.g. cosine-Lanczos) get closer to an ideal spectral response but require a large number of weights; not practical for shorter time series

# ## Practical implementation
